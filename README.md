# Diabetes Risk Detection project

Project Goal:
To identify the key risk factors for diabetes.
1.Which gender has the highest prevalence of diabetes in this data?
2.Which gender has a higher chance of developing diabetes, and how does this vary with age?
3.Does hypertension increase the risk of developing diabetes?
4.Can a heart attack increase a person's risk of developing diabetes?
5.How does having both hypertension and a heart attack impact the risk of developing diabetes?
6.Is there a link between smoking and diabetes?
7.How much does hemoglobin impact diabetes?
8.What is the relationship between blood glucose levels and diabetes?
9.Is there any relationship between BMI and diabetes?
10.Develop a model to predict whether an individual is at risk of developing diabetes.

The project will be beneficial to a variety of stakeholders, including:

Individuals: Individuals can use the predictive model to assess their own risk of developing diabetes and take steps to reduce their risk.
Healthcare providers: Healthcare providers can use the predictive model to identify patients at risk of developing diabetes and provide them with early intervention and prevention measures.
Public health officials: Public health officials can use the insights from the project to develop and implement programs to prevent and manage diabetes at the population level.
